# Case Management Database Design

## Executive Summary
This project focuses on developing a MongoDB database system to efficiently manage legal cases, client information, case details, and court dates. The system aims to streamline case management processes, centralize relevant information, and facilitate effective communication among stakeholders involved in legal proceedings.

## Project Requirements
1. Comprehensive storage and management of legal cases, including case details, status, and related documents.
2. Efficient organization and retrieval of client information, such as contact details, case history, and associated documents.
3. Scheduling and tracking of court dates, hearings, and other relevant events.
4. Integration with document management systems for seamless handling of case-related documents.
5. User-friendly interface for accessing, updating, and analyzing case data.
6. Robust security measures to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
7. Scalability to accommodate a growing number of cases and users.
